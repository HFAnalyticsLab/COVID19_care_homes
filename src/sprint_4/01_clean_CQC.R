### What is it?
# A longitudinal record of care homes regulated by the CQC along with their characteristics,
# such as bed capacity, specialties, open and close date etc.

### Format
# - each row corresponds to a period of time (from mincqcfiledate to maxcqcfiledate) for which the 
#  characteristics of one care home (pseudo_ch_id) were valid 
# - care homes can have multiple rows, that correspond to different time periods of different lengths
# - in addition, there is information on when the care home opened and closed 

# Where do we want to get to?
# a monthly snap shot of the characteristics of each carehome, over time in order to extract
# the characteristics for care homes that were open in January 2019 and January 2020


# Load raw data ---------------------------------------------------------------

chchar_raw <- read_delim(str_c(raw_data_path, "care home paper/pseudo_carehome_characteristics_mar20.csv"),
                         delim = "Â¬") %>% 
  mutate_at(c("mincqcfiledate", "maxcqcfiledate", "ch_startdate", "ch_enddate"), as.Date) 

            
# Cleaning ----------------------------------------------------------------


### Aspects that require cleaning
# 1. Missing data values that are not NA
# 2. Filling in missing values, especially in the open and close date, from more complete rows for the same care home
# 3. Remove duplicate rows. 
# 4. All rows with chactive = 1 show 0 beds, but they always seem to happen shortly after a 
# care home opens - is this a line the system adds when a care home opens?
# 5. Some rows list 0 beds, even when chactive = 0. Fill in bed numbers from other rows.
# 6. Sometimes entries for the same care home are valid for overlapping time periods. Need to be resolved.
# 7. gSometimes there are gaps between records for the same care home. Need to be filled in.
# 8. Conversion to monthly time series
# -----------------

# 1. Missing values not coded as NA
# Excel seems to show missing dates as "1899-12-30"

chchar <- chchar_raw %>% 
  mutate_at(vars("ch_startdate", "ch_enddate"), ~ na_if(., ymd("1899-12-30")))

summary(chchar_raw) # confirm no missing values in any other variable

# 2. Cleaning dates

# fill in missing open and close dates, use earliest open date and latest close date in
# case there are multiple for the same care home 
chchar <- chchar %>% 
  group_by(pseudo_ch_id) %>% 
  mutate(ch_startdate_filled = min(ch_startdate, na.rm = TRUE),
         ch_enddate_filled = max(ch_enddate, na.rm = TRUE))%>% 
  mutate_at(c("ch_startdate_filled", "ch_enddate_filled"), ~na_if(., Inf)) %>% 
  mutate_at(c("ch_startdate_filled", "ch_enddate_filled"), ~na_if(., -Inf)) %>% 
  ungroup()


# where open dates are completely missing, use the earliest cqcfiledate or the close date, 
# whichever was earlier

# if the open date is after the close date, replace with the close date

# standardise the open and close date by setting them to the first of the respective month
# if a care home opens in a given month, we'll assume it was open for the whole month
# if a care home closes in a given month, we'll assume it was closed for the whole month
# - > 1. this will make it easier to match these dates to MPI extract dates
# -> 2. this will make sure there are no gaps or overlaps if the name and therefore the id of a care home changes
