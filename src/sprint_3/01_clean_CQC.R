### What is it?
# A longitudinal record of care homes regulated by the CQC along with their characteristics,
# such as bed capacity, specialties etc.

### Format
# - each row corresponds to a period of time (from mincqcfiledate to maxcqcfiledate) for which the 
#  characteristics of one care home (pseudo_ch_id) were valid 
# - care homes can have multiple rows, that correspond to different time periods of different lengths
# - in addition, there is information on when the care home opened and closed 

# Where do we want to get to?
# a monthly snap shot of the characteristics of each carehome, over time 


# Load raw data ---------------------------------------------------------------

chchar_raw <- read_delim(str_c(raw_data_path, "pseudo_carehome_characteristics_mar20.csv"),
                         delim = "Â¬") %>% 
  mutate_at(c("mincqcfiledate", "maxcqcfiledate", "ch_startdate", "ch_enddate"), as.Date) 

            
# Cleaning ----------------------------------------------------------------


### Aspects that require cleaning
# 1. Missing data values that are not NA
# 2. Filling in missing values, especially in the open and close date, from more complete rows
# 3. Remove complete duplicates. 
# 4. All rows with chactive = 1 are missing show 0 beds, but they always happen shortly after a 
# care home opens - is this a the system adds when a care home opens?
# 5. Some rows list 0 beds, even when chactive = 0
# 6. overlapping time periods for a care home
# 7. gaps between adjacent time periods
# 8. conversion to time series
# -----------------

# 1. Missing values not coded as NA
# Excel seems to show missing dates as "1899-12-30"

chchar <- chchar_raw %>% 
  mutate_at(vars("ch_startdate", "ch_enddate"), ~ na_if(., ymd("1899-12-30")))

summary(chchar_raw) # no missing values in any other variable

# 2. Cleaning dates

# fill in missing open and close dates, use earliest open date and latest close date in
# case there are multiple
chchar <- chchar %>% 
  group_by(pseudo_ch_id) %>% 
  mutate(ch_startdate_filled = min(ch_startdate, na.rm = TRUE),

# where close date is missing we are assuming the care home is still open, fill in with the 
# latest extract date

# where open dates are completely missing, use the earliest cqcfiledate or the close date, 
# whichever was earlier

# if the open date is after the close date, replace with the close date

# standardise the open and close date by setting them to the first of the respective month
# if a care home opens in a given month, we'll assume it was open for the whole month
# if a care home closes in a given month, we'll assume it was closed for the whole month
